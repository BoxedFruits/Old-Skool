-- There will always be 3 positions for 3 perks. This script will determine their positions as well as get references to the Image MUID

-- Change the Image with ScriptÂ¶
-- If you have an asset reference to an image (or its MUID), you can use the UIImage:SetImage() function.

-- Images can also be manually set to show a player's profile picture by using the UIImage:SetPlayerProfile() function.
